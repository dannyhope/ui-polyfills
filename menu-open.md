# menu-open.js

Expects structure roughly as a heading to click on to open (`h2`) and a list (`ul`) of links (`a`).

## Sequence:

1. Mouse down on heading
2. Menu opens
3. Move through open menu items
4. Menu items receive hover state (though actually applying `.hover` class)
5. Mouse up emulates a click on that item

## Code also supports:

* clicking to open menu, then clicking any menu item
* clicking anywhere outside of menu to close menu
* `target="_blank"` on links to open in a new window

## Note

If you're using jQuery (or some such) to hook event handles, you will need to change the line that set `window.location` and trigger a click on the target element `e.target`.
